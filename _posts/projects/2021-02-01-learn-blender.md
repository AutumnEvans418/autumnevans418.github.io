Over Christmas break I started watching videos on Blender, a 3D modeling software that can do just about anything.  It's always been a desire of mine to add Blender to my skillset, but has been a daunting task.  I began following a [donut tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPrnSACiTJ4), learning the very basics of 3D modeling.  It was a little tedious, but I was pretty happy with the result.

My goal was to take what I learned and apply that knowledge to game development, but I came out of the month of learning with inspiration to do more.

I started tinkering with 3D animation and came up with this among us character.

I also started messing around with physics and realized quickly why fast expensive hardware is needed.  Took me hours to render this.

My most recent work has been an [animated background for my desktop](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/l4f7aw/made_my_own_animated_desktop_background_in_blender/).

A friend recommended that I post this on reddit and it [blew up instantly](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/l4f7aw/made_my_own_animated_desktop_background_in_blender/).  People loved my animation so much that I decided to make it available for [free](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/l89stg/due_to_popular_demand_here_is_my_animated_desktop/).  I also organized my desktop better, as people didn't like my organization so much :laughing:.

Blender allows me to express my creativity in new way other than programming and painting.  It will definitely become a powerful tool on my toolbelt.
