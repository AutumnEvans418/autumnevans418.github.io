I went to South Korea over the summer and had to write a 30 page paper about the country.  By the time I had all the resources, I had no idea how I wanted to organize them.  I started creating hashtags to sort my references so I could search for #teaching and get all the paragraphs that are related.  This ended up being very challenging with so many references.  I wanted a list of all my hash tags and the related text.  I couldn't find any solution for this, so I created one!

In a couple hours, I was able to get a add-in for word working features such as:

- hashtag highlighting
- hashtag count
- search bar
- click to go to the location in word.

I think this may be limited use for most people, but it definitely saved me a ton of time, so I made the source code and the add-in available for download!

Enjoy!
