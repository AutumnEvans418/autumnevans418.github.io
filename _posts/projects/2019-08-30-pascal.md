I have always been interested in programming languages even before I knew how to program.  It's probably been one of the most challenging projects, but I made a compiler and interpreter for pascal.  This compiler is not feature complete.  It's more of a test project.  But I have learned a lot from building this.

I even built an IDE for the compiler I created that shows errors and output.  It also shows the node tree and the csharp output.
