Learning to program is hard.  Dedication is required to master software development.  Students often struggle with the lack of feedback from their code.  How do you know if you are doing it right?  Professors also struggle to grade code.  Grading student's code requires professors to download it, compile it, run it, and review the source code.  Visual Studio Gradebook solves all these problems by providing a unit test style feedback system for students and publishing of their code right in visual studio.  Professors can view student's code and see the results without the need to download their project or running it.  It will also show how many tests the student's code passed.  They can also see if the code was plagarized.
