I have worked on a lot of different projects over the years and most of them have been difficult to showcase.  Thus, I created this website so I can showcase some of the work I do and keep track of the progress that I make.

As you can tell by the url, this site is hosted by github pages.  It uses jekyll to build the static site and embed the various programs.

Almost all of what I have worked on is open source and is available for people to use.  Feel free to check out my blogs, games, projects, and music!
