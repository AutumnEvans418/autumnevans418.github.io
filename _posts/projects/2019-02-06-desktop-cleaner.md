As developers we use a lot of different apps.  We download samples, take screenshots, and clutter our desktop with files.  It's a pain to try to keep our desktop clean, so I created a program that will do it for me.  Desktop Cleaner is a console app that will move files on my desktop to folders based on their file type.  In most cases this makes it really easy for me to find what I need.

There is some logic and associations.  Images will all be put into one folder (jpg,png, etc.)

The code is less than 100 lines of code and a really simple solution for a common problem that I have.
