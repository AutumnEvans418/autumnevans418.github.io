How far is the first android app I published.  It was done for mobile apps class at Pittsburg State University.  How Far? allows you to measure any object relative to any other object.  Want to measure the moon with cats? No problem!  How far can do that.

How far uses a tree-like datastructure sql database to store the relationships between measurements.  To measure the moon with cats, just add cats to the app using inches, feet, miles, whatever you'd like to use.

When you compare an object, the tree is search top down.  Every node has a ratio that is multiplied/divided depending on the tranverse direction.  This allows for any measurement to be associated with any other.
