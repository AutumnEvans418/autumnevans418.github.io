I've always been a fan of horror games. From the AAA experiences of Dead Space to the simple spooks of Slender Man, they have always peeked my curiousity and interest.  I've decided to start working on my own horror game based on a popular world of horror: the SCP Foundation.  More specifically, my game is based on [SCP-610](http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-610) (SCP is the name of the monsters contained by the secret foundation).  I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/l4b9uh/an_scp610_game_i_am_working_on/) on the SCP reddit with my progress and I'm overwelmed with the amount of support and interest people have!  Thank you for all the support.

I will have more to show as I make progress.  This is the largest project I've done to date, and I'm super excited to finish and release it.
