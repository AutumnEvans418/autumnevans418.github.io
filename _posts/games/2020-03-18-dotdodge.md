What would you make if you were given 1 hour to make a game?  This is what I came up with:  A simple flappy bird style shoot-em up game with a bloomy retro style.  You can play it here.

This challenged me to finish a game no matter how good it was.  I had to think of something simple that wouldn't lead to feature creap.  I eventually thought about using only one input and simple physics and collisions.

I was able to get the game running in just about an hour.  Of course, I went ahead and did some polishing, such as adding a main menu, and a score.

Building dotdodge later inspired me to build plagueforce, a game based on the same code base with far more features and content.
