Since I am spending a lot more time at home these days, I decided to take the time to learn some unity3d.  This is my first full game with unity.  You can play here on this site and see how I made plagueforce.

## Plot
Our greatest fears have come to life: the world is out of toilet paper. Fortunately, you have some to spare. Put on the mask, get in the plane, and prepare for a long flight. But beware! Infected bats are all over the skies! Shoot the bats with syringes before they touch you, collect toilet paper on your journey, and deliver as much toilet paper as you can!

## Inpsiration 

My goal for this game was to make something that was as simple as possible.  After failing multiple times with various other ideas, I learned quickly that I needed to start small.  I wanted to create something that was unique to play and was based off a single input.

After tossing some ideas around, I thought of using the flappy bird controllers in a shoot em up style game.  I also was inspired by the current crisis and wanted to make something that could be a time waster while spending time in quarantine.

## Development Process

All the of art and music was made by me.  I illustrator to make all of my art and aggressively googled how to animate the characters.

The music was created using FL studio and the sound effects were created with Bfxr.

I work as a C# Developer at my job, so the coding was pretty simple to some degree, but it did require some digging into the documentation and watching youtube videos to get the ads to work and other amazing services that unity provides.

## Conclusion

Overall, I am really proud of what I accomplished and look forward to my next project.
