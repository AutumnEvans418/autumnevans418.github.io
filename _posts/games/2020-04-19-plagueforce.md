Since I am spending a lot more time at home these days, I decided to take the time to learn some Unity3D.  Plagueforce is my first full game made with unity, which you can play here on this site.

### Plot
Below is the plot I created for the game: A pandemic inspired game to waste time while we social distance.

Our greatest fears have come to life: the world is out of toilet paper. Fortunately, you have some to spare. Put on the mask, get in the plane, and prepare for a long flight. But beware! Infected bats are all over the skies! Shoot the bats with syringes before they touch you, collect toilet paper on your journey, and deliver as much toilet paper as you can!

### Features
The features included in the game are:
- Multiple enemies types and bosses
- Multiple powerups
- Level, experience, and shop system
- Ads that can be removed
- High score system

### Inspiration 
My goal for this game was to make something that was as simple as possible.  After failing multiple times with various other ideas, I learned quickly that I needed to start small.  I wanted to create something that was unique to play and was based off a single input.

After tossing some ideas around, I thought of using the flappy bird controls in a shoot em up style game.  I also was inspired by the current crisis and wanted to make something that could be a time waster while social distancing.

### Development Process
Within in hour I was able to get a basic prototype working.  By that, of course, I mean a circle that can jump and avoid other circles.

This is the basic mechanics of the game that I expanded with different enemies, powerups, and bosses.

Some of the features that took the longest were things that every game should have, like menus, settings, UI, etc.

All the of art and music was made by me.  I illustrator to make all of my art and aggressively googled how to animate the characters.

The music was created using FL studio and the sound effects were created with Bfxr.

### Conclusion

Overall, I am really proud of what I accomplished and look forward to my next project.
