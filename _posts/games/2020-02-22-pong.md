QuadroPong is a local 4 player game that I built with MonoGame.  It has ai players, astroids, bosses, powerups, and more.  I was working on implementing online multiplayer before moving to unity3d.  There are many more features I would like to add, but this game is playable as it is.  See the game in action...
