2048 was created in 2014 by a 19 year old developer that wrote the game in a single weekend.  In than a week, it recieved over 4 million visitors.

Puzzles absolutely facinate me.  They force us to think differently about problems they may seem similar to other stimuli.  2048 is a game that seems easy, but becomes more challenging the further you play.  As you make larger numbers, it requires x^2 many cells to be combined to combine that large number.  Overtime, you'll have three 512 cells with no space to move.  2048 is such a well designed game because it increases in difficulty as part of the game design.

I wanted to see if I could re-create 2048 and create an ai that could solve it.  Unfortunately, it seems that 2048 is random enough that it just becomes chance on winning once you get to the larger tiles.  I orginally wrote this as a WPF app with C#, but I ported it to the browser using Bridge.Net and Retyped.
