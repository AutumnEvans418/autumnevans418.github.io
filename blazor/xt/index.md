Xaml is much like html in that they are both markup languages that can become very verbose.  One of the things that has helped improved the expressiveness of html in the .net world is Asp.net's Razor engine.  Xaml so far doesn't have anything like the razor engine, so I decided to see what it would take to build something like razor that could be used with any Xaml project, just like how you can use static html with razor.
